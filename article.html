        <h2>A Debut Show!</h2>
        <p>The Beatles’ American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show stands as one of the most iconic moments in the history of popular culture. On February 9, 1964, four young men from Liverpool—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—appeared on American television for the first time, sending shockwaves through the nation and solidifying their place as global superstars.</p>

        <h3>What's next for the Beatles?</h3>
        <p>After the groundbreaking performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, the question on everyone's lips was: what’s next for The Beatles? The answer, it seems, is nothing short of world domination. The band's first U.S. tour is already in the works, with planned stops in major cities like Washington, D.C., New York, and Miami. The demand for tickets is overwhelming, and promoters are bracing for sell-out crowds. 
            Beyond touring, The Beatles are already eyeing the next steps in their musical journey. With the release of their first film, A Hard Day’s Night, scheduled for later this year, the band is set to take Hollywood by storm, proving their versatility as entertainers. They are also working on new music, with plans for additional studio albums that will continue to push boundaries and shape the future of rock ‘n’ roll.</p>
